#summary Information about exporting data from BioloMICS.

= Introduction =

There are two recommended methods for exporting 'shared data' from BioloMICS. Both use features from within the application, so there is no need to access the backend database MySQL.

== Method 1 - Export without Template. ==
Recommended if you are sharing minimal data from every record (for example a list of strain numbers and species names held in the collection). [#Export_without_Template More details]

== Method 2 - Amend VB.NET script. ==
Recommended if you want to hold back reference to particular records, or provide more detailed information (for example, images and bibliographic records). [#Amend_VB.NET_script More Details]

=Export without Template=
Log in to BioloMICS, and the database you want to share. Select menu item `Import-Export -> Export all records -> To file without template`:

At the `Export file without template` window, click fields in the left pane and the right-pointing arrow. Fields for sharing will then show in the right pane. Use the left-pointing arrow to remove fields if you make a mistake.

Click the `Export and close` button and save the output file as CSV or tab-delimited. You can check the file contents with an application like Excel or Notepad. It will show the column headers, and a single row for every record, similar to:

||ID	||Name	||E394: Species name	||H410: Sample date||
||2	||TT 1	||Arxiozyma telluris	||Feb-03||
||3	||TT 2	||Candida albicans	||Feb-00||
||4	||TT 3	||Candida albicans	||28/04/2000||
||5	||TT 4	||Candida albicans (stellatoidea)	||19/05/2000||
